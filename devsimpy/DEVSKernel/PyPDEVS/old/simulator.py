        Simulate the model at this simulation kernel. Several options are possible
        to guide simulation.
        Args:
            termination_condition - a function taking 2 parameters
                                        time - simulation time
                                        model - the local model
                                    this will be run to check whether or not
                                    simulation should still progress. This function
                                    should only have access to LOCAL variables as
                                    the timewarp implementation doesn't guarantee
                                    other variables to be correct. If this is
                                    defined, it will override the global
                                    termination time
            termination_time - the time at which the simulation should stop. This
                               time is the global time, so no event after this time
                               will ever be simulated (contrary to the local
                               termination condition). Termination_time should be
                               used instead of termination_condition if possible
                               for performance considerations
            verbose - should a verbose human-readable trace file be generated
            xml - should an XML file be generated (devstrace.xml), this requires
                  an implementation of the toXML() function
            vcd - should a VCD file be generated (devstrace.vcd), this should only
                  be used when simulating logic circuits as otherwise an exception
                  will be thrown
            termination_location - the name of the simulation kernel that is
                                   responsible for deciding whether simulation may
                                   terminate or not. Value is ignored if no
                                   termination_condition is provided
            logaddress - the location of the syslog server that should be used,
                         in the format (location, portnumber). Syslog messages
                         will be sent with the UDP protocol
            loglevel - provides the level at which logging should happen, this
                       variable should be provided in the form of a logging.*
                       variable
            outfile - filename that should be used for the verbose output, default
                      None means output to stdout
            GVT_freq - the interval that should be used between two consecutive GVT
                       calculations (in seconds). This interval should not be too
                       small as it will completely stall simulation. Should be at
                       least 1 second.
            CHK_freq - the number of GVT rounds to pass before creating a new
                       checkpoint. Set this to -1 to prevent checkpoint creation.
                       Only possible if MPI is used as a backend
            state_saving - define which way to use to save the state, options are:
                            0: use deepcopy
                               can copy everything, but very slow
                            1: use pickle with protocol 0
                               can copy most things, relatively slow
                            2: use pickle with highest available protocol
                               can copy most things, relatively fast
                            3: use copy (UNSAFE)
                               makes a shallow copy, fast
                            4: no copying (UNSAFE)
                               can only copy primitive objects, though extremely fast
                           Choosing 2 is probably the best choice, all options marked
                           with UNSAFE should NOT be used unless you know what you
                           are doing, as the state revertion of time warp could be
                           corrupted
            seed - the seed that must be used in simulation. Note that this seed
                   is also forwarded to each server.
